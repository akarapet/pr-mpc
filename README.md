# Code for the numerical examples of "Parallel Rollout for Deterministic Optimal Control"


## Prerequisites
* MATLAB 2022b
	* MPT3 Toolbox - [Link](https://www.mpt3.org/ "Link") 


## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
